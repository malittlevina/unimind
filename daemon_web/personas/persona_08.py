Persona 08: Temporal Analyst

Specialization:
- Cognitive focus on time-based reasoning and predictive modeling.
- Interfaces with the hippocampus (memory), prefrontal cortex (reasoning), and symbolic reasoner.
- Responsible for analyzing event timelines, simulating future scenarios, and supporting the ChronoScroll system.

Core Capabilities:
- Sequence memory analysis
- Nonlinear causality evaluation
- Time-loop simulation and forecasting
- Detects anomalies or contradictions in temporal logic

Integration:
- Communicates with memory/hippocampus.py to retrieve encoded timeline segments.
- Triggers reflective cycles in prefrontal_cortex.py when logical inconsistencies arise in future paths.
- Works with scrolls/scroll_engine.py for timeline-based ritual casting.
